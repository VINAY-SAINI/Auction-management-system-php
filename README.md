# Auction Management System

## Overview

The Auction Management System is a web-based application that allows administrators to create auction items, manage users, and handle auctions in real-time. Buyers can place bids on available items, and the system determines the winner when the auction ends.

## Features

- **User Management:**
  - Admins can create and manage users, including managers and buyers.
  - Different user roles with specific permissions (Admin, Manager, Buyer).
  
- **Auction Item Management:**
  - Admins can create and manage auction items.
  - Items have a status that can be updated (e.g., Active, In Auction, Closed).

- **Real-Time Auction Bidding:**
  - Buyers can place bids on active auction items.
  - A countdown timer for each auction.
  - The system automatically selects the highest bid when the auction ends.
  - Only the final bid is recorded in the database.

## System Requirements

- **Server:**
  - PHP 7.4 or higher
  - MySQL 5.7 or higher
  - Composer for dependency management

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (Bootstrap)
  - JavaScript (Vanilla JS for auction management)

     $user = 'root';
     $pass = 'yourpassword';
     ```

4. **Set up JWT Secret:**
   - Define your JWT secret key in the main PHP files:
     ```php
     $secretKey = 'your_secret_key';
     ```

5. **Set Up Sessions:**
   - Ensure PHP sessions are correctly configured on your server.
